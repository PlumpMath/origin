# Motivation
I first started developing Origin in 2012 as an exercise in WPF shell development using Prism and Unity. Origin is a simple WPF shell that implements the AvalonDock docking system along with a custom navigation bar for hosting modules in a document style layout that supports MVVM. It is an ideal platform for developers who need to start writing line-of-business functionality without having to worry about writing a shell from scratch. So, in 2015 I finally decided to dust of the cover and publish it.
